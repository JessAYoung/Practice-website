      <p>Sewing is not just sewing machines as the great Zac Efron once said
      <blockquote><q>When i'm stylizing it's all about accessories
        </q></blockquote>

        <p>Everyone needs a good pair of scissors my favorite kind are my Ginghers. I own two pairs one are normal
          scissors that open and close with the movement of your hand which are 8 inchs long.
          The others are spring action dress makers shears that are also 8inchs.
          The Spring Loaded ones are great for large cutting projects such as cutting out patterns.
          The regular ones are more used for touch ups, such as cutting threads and making corners look sharp.

        <p>My 3D Printer the Elegoo Neptune 3 in its short time with me has become my favorite piece of equipment, I
          have printed many objects not related to sewing but that is soon to change.
          With my original purpose of getting the printer being to build cosplay armor I quickly discovered that it has
          many ways to incorporate 3D printing into fabric.
          Here are some examples of other peoples projects combining these two fields
